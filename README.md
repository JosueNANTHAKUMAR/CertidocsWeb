- **Objective:** Ensure signatures on emails, PDFs, and images can be verified
- **Preconditions:** Signed content is available
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Open the extension
  2. Click "Verify Signature"
  3. Upload the signed content or let the extension detect it automatically (for emails)
  4. Start verification
- **Expected Outcome:** The integrity and authenticity of the signed content is confirmed

#### Scenario 4: Attempted Modification of a Signed Email
- **Role Involved:** Malicious User
- **Objective:** Ensure the system detects modifications after signing
- **Preconditions:** A signed email is available
